          <h2>Software QA Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            In my current role as a Software QA Engineer I am tasked with
            creating automation testing for all new features as well as
            maintaining and organizing previous automation testing for concise
            regression testing at the end of every sprint. The scope of what I
            test varies on a story by story basis, which allows me to work with
            UI testing, network testing, load testing, and payment testing all
            in equal measure.
          </p>
          <h2>Application Solutions Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            During my 3 years as an Application Solutions Engineer (ASE) I was
            fortunate enough to participate in both the software development
            process, as well as the business process behind it. As an ASE It was
            my responsibility to act as a technical resource for our clients in
            order to help our development team plan future features based on
            client needs. I was also responsible for maintaining the integrity
            of our database by writing automation to fix irregular or improper
            data. Since my role was that of a "jack of all trades", it fell to
            my team and I to help resolve any high severity issues that came in,
            and my unique perspective as an ASE often proved to be the factor
            which got the issue resolved.
